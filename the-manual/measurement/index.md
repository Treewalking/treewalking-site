## Introduction

This section covers the 'Why', 'What' and 'How' of Measurement. For a quick brief discussion on this section, please
read the [How and What to Measure?](/blog/how-and-what-to-measure/) post.

## Principles

### Automation, Automation, Automation

Regardless of what you chose measure, the guiding principle is to avoid manual collection and presentation of the data.
Unless you achieve this capability, the value of what you are measuring becomes weakened due it being seen as a burden, 
and an unnecessary amount of paper work. This information should be real-time, available and transparent. 

### Purpose and Intent

The reason we collect this data is to drive continuous improvement at all levels of the organisation. It is not a 
performance management tool.
