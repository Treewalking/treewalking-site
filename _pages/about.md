Treewalking is an odd name I came up with a long time ago to represent the many different techniques and styles used
over the years within Product Delivery. I have been lucky enough to work in this industry during the Agile, DevOps and
Lean revolutions, but also while organisations grappled with the off-shore, near-shore and on-shore resourcing models.

Treewalking brings together a collection of minds that have worked through this period for a range of organisations and
industries. It particularly focuses on a period of time when we got the opportunity to bring our
collective minds together and built a Product Delivery organisation from the ground up. Treewalking is really the manual
for how this was done, including the mistakes, in a hope that our experience will help others on this journey.

This subject area is already well covered both from individual authors and industry research. We do not intend to create
yet another model. Instead, we will cover how we used all this information and combined it with our own experiences
to create a Lean Product Deliver organisation.
