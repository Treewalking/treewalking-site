This is the ninth State of DevOps report. That's almost a decade of research and findings. The trend continues to 
highlight the need apply the same level of scrutiny and quality we use on our products onto our internal platforms. The
era of low quality internal IT is coming to an end.

This aligns with our observations over the last decade. IT organisations tend to use vendors to provide some type of 
internal IT platform, but do not treat this as a product delivery. In the cases where these capabilities for part of the
product delivery pipeline, then all the gains made during the DevOps and Agile transformation are lost as a result of 
trying to use low quality and high-friction internal platforms. Product thinking in this area is crucial. Re-focusing 
on outcome and being accountable against the same lead times the rest of the product delivery teams are measured against
aligns the whole organisation.
