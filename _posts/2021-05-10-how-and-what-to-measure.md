> Before you start talking about what to measure, you need to go back and think about your intent. 

We've working in many environments where the organisation has picked up a standard set of Agile metrics in a hope that
this will inform them that they're making the correct level of progress. But what constitutes progress? 

There are a huge number of metrics that can
be measured, and a lot of industry literature associated with these metrics. In most cases this has happened in a 
functional vacuum. In other words, we were only measuring to the boundary of our control, and not the final business
outcome. This meant we were measuring what we thought represented success, but it was only part of the picture and
didn't tell us if we working on the right things.

This article looks at the indicators that represent successful outcomes for the wider business, why they are important
and how you can start measuring these indicators.
