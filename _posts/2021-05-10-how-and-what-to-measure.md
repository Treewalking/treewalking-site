> Before you start talking about what to measure, you need to go back and think about your intent. 

We've working in many environments where the organisation has picked up a standard set of Agile metrics in a hope that
this will inform them that they're making the correct level of progress. There are a huge number of metrics that can
be measured, and a lot of industry literature associated with these metrics. In most cases this has happened in a 
functional vacuum. In other words, we were only measuring to the boundary of our control, and not the final business
outcome.
